# guard/ — loop-hygiene guard family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `guard/` group watches common failure patterns in the agent loop. `repeat-tool-reminder` nudges a model that repeats an identical tool call without progress. `timeout-policy` gives declared tool deadlines a clear timed-out result instead of stalling the session. `todo-completion-guard` gives a closing turn one chance to reconcile unfinished plan items. All three ship enabled in the `dsh` base bundle; a composition can tune or remove them.

## Packages

Three small plugins cover the patterns; each README below explains when to keep, tune, or remove it.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`repeat-tool-reminder/`](repeat-tool-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when it repeats the same tool call, so it changes approach or finishes |
| [`timeout-policy/`](timeout-policy/README.md) | Times out tool calls that declare a limit, so the model gets a clear error instead of waiting forever |
| [`todo-completion-guard/`](todo-completion-guard/README.md) | Steers one advisory notice when a turn closes on an unfinished todo list |
